# AyeHandSum - Makes Deeds HandSum! (TM)

# Inspired by the Open Hand Monument, Chandigarh, India
# Ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Hand_Monument

# Disclaimer: This is intended to be an "Artful SHA Encoding" with
# Unicode hand and arm related emojis. We have tried our best
# to leave out a few emojis that we felt were offensive. However,
# given the complexity of cross cultural glyph interpretation,
# it is very likely that we may have missed out a few more that
# could be considered offensive in other cultures. We strongly
# urge you to bring such cultural issues to our notice. Ideally,
# a small write-up or pointer to an easily understandable article
# on the topic will help our volunteers understand the cultural
# context and make modifications.

# Disclaimer: Dropping any specific hand or arm oriented symbol
# that may be available in Unicode is merely coincidental and
# an expression of our creative freedom. The appearance of any
# sequence of symbols in this file or in the output generated,
# by appropriately executing this file as a set of computer 
# instructions, that have any relation to any individual, event,
# or any entity is merely coincidental with a mathematical
# mapping to the provided input, and is not intended to hurt the
# feelings, emotions or sentiments of any individual or group.

# Legal notice: The algorithm, mechanism, design used in this software,
# are covered under multiple pending patent applications by the auhtors.
# The release of this software does not constiture public disclosure and
# the reader is expeced to

# Legal notice: All issues must be logged on the online issue tracking
# systems made available through the original point of distribution.
# We cannot track replica repositories as it is simply not feasible
# for us to track all such replicas or redistributions. Owing to
# resource constraints we are not able to provide any timeline to
# the expected time needed for providing a resolution. If the original
# point of distribution of this software is not traceable, or trackable,
# or otherwise available, then any and all licenses granted stand revoked
# and the user is not allowed to use, modify or distribute this software
# with immediate effect.

# Legal notice: Where the output on a given input is known to be offensive,
# this software must not be used on such inputd in original or derivative
# distribution form unless the offensive output is eliminated from the range
# of possible outputs of the original distribution. For each distirbution,
# each successive derivative must oblige this clause by propagating modifications
# made for eliminating offensive output back to the previous distribution.

# Legal notice: AyeHandSum and AyeHandCode are claimed as trademarks
# or business marks by Abhishek Choudhary. Modified distributions must not
# use these marks or names for the distribution, and any similar names or
# marks such as handsum or handcode which may be in use or in vogue in
# contexts otherwise, are also specifically prohibited from being applied
# to such modified distributions. We claim and reserve the right to apply
# any combinations of words handsome, handsum, and handcode, including
# the root words themselves to any derivative of this software, and 
# therefore derivatives are not allowed to be distributed using any
# marks or names composed, or otherwise derived from the specific words.

# Legal notice: The glyphs shown here with a single finger held
# out do not show the offensive finger jesture on our systems and
# consist of index finger (second digit) or the thumb extended.
# This software may not be downloaded, installed, executed or
# otherwise utilized or accessed on systems here this condition
# cannot be guaranteed. Any clauses not applicable under the laws of
# the land are to be considered deleted from the terms of the license
# agreement, without impact on the remaining clauses, and all the
# good standing clauses, applicable under the law of the land, must be
# read together along with all the good standing, and applicable,
# notices and disclaimers given herein, at the original source of the
# software, along with the terms and conditions applicable to registered
# and unregistered users at https://ayeai.xyz

# Disclaimer: The name AyeHandSum is phonetically similar to the
# adjective handsome in the current form of the English language and may
# be used to denote non-gender neutral features. This is absolutely
# not the intended connotation of the invented word AyeHandSum used
# in the naming of this software and the human hand is a symbol of all
# the goodness of hard working socially responsible individuals,
# without any relation to gender (MFLGBTQ+) - that, as such, is the personal
# opinion of the original authors and the connotation must be interpreted
# to remain gender neutral in all derivatives. We strongly believe that 
# "the hands that rock the cradle are the hands that SHAPE the world".
# (After William Ross Wallace)
# Ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hand_That_Rocks_the_Cradle_(poem)
#
# Our translation of the phrase in Hindi -
# हाथ वो जो झूला झुलाएं, विश्व को स्वर्णिम वही बनाएं (TM)

# Disclaimer: The connotation to handsome in the formation of AyeHandSum
# is not about physical beauty but about the beauty of the inner self.
# As for physical beauty we strongly believe that its purely contextual
# as in the words of Lord Byron -
# One shade the more, one ray the less, had half impaired the nameless grace.
#
# And, SINCE,
# Beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder, and the deeds of the individual.
# THEREFORE,
# Lets make our deeds handsome(TM)

# allowed to modify any terms or conditions, or clauses, or the license
# under which this software has been distributed. All disputes are subject
# to the jurisdiction of courts in Hyderabad, Telangana, India.

# Disclaimer: We have dropped the hand symbol related to begging as we
# believe the glyph goes against our ethos and philosophy. A society that
# cannot help its citizens in need has a long way to go towards achieving
# its true potential. This is in no way a stand against philanthropy and we
# empathize with individuals in need. There is nothing wrong as per
# our understanding and cultural context in asking for help, while helping
# a fellow human in need is the greatest deed of kindness. This is in
# no way an opinion for or against the beliefs of individuals and
# organizations that believe in the inclusion of the glyph and they may
# do so in their derivatives of this software, subject to the other clauses
# of the license under which these software have been distributed. The exclusion
# of the glyph is merely an "artistic expression of our belief" that the NEED for
# begging must be eliminated through concerted effort, and if it must remain
# then it must be so for us as humans to beg to be of use to others and the
# society towards greater glory for humankind on Earth and beyond.

# Note: How about calling this "The Table of HandSum Unity"?

# Note: We have specifically included the Vulcan salute, as we believe that
# it is probabilistically naive to presume we are alone in the vastness of the
# universe, and whenever that first contact happens human hands and their
# glyphical representations are most likely to provide the first non ambiguous
# means of information interchange. Hopefully, AyeHandSum or its derivatives
# will have a positive role to play - so help us Mr Spock! 🖖 LLAP
